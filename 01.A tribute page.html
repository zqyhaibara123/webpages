                <h4>Here’s a time line of Madam Curie’s life:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>1867</b> - born in Warsaw, in the Russian partition of Poland</li>
                  <li><b>1877</b> - attends the boarding school of J. Sikorska; then an gymnasium for girls</li>
                  <li><b>1885</b> - Maria makes an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she will give her financial assistance during Bronisława' s medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with this, Maria first takes a position as a home tutor in Warsaw; then a governess a landed family.</li>
                  <li><b>1893</b> - obtains a degree in physics and begins work in an industrial laboratory of Professor Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continues studying at the University of Paris, and earns a second degree in the next year.</li>
                  <li><b>1895</b> - marries with Pierre Curie, an young instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry.</li>
                  <li><b>1898</b> - Curie and her husband publish a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named "polonium", in honour of her native Poland.</li>
                  <li><b>1903</b> - shares the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel.</li>
                  <li><b>1906</b> - Pierre is killed in a road accident, Curie is bitterly sad. The physics department of the University of Paris decides to retain the chair that had been created for Pierre and to offer it to Marie. She is the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.</li>
                  <li><b>1910</b> - Curie succeeds in isolating radium. she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that is eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.</li>
                  <li><b>1911</b> - wins the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.This award is "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."</li>
                  <li><b>1912</b> - focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914.</li>
                  <li><b>1914</b>- Curie's second Nobel Prize enables her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, where research is conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.</li>
                  <li><b>1934</b> - dies at the age of 66, due to aplastic anemia brought on by exposure to radiation while carrying test tubes of radium in her pockets during research, and in the course of her service in World War Imobile X-ray units that she has set up.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 style="line-height:1.5;margin:20px 0">"The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked."</h5>
